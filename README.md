# Pump_Cavitation
Performance Monitoring and Prediction of Cavitation in Centrifugal Pumps.

# What is Cavitation?
Cavitation is the formation of bubbles or cavities in liquid, developed in areas of relatively low pressure around an impeller. The imploding or collapsing of these bubbles trigger intense shockwaves inside the pump, causing significant damage to the impeller and/or the pump housing.

# Reasons for Pump Cavitation
When Net Positive Suction Head Available (NPSHA)  is less than Net positive suction head required (NPSHR) which is NPSHA < NPSHR
Minimum required flowrate across the pump which is pump spillback. There must be vendor or licensor recommended flowrate of pump which should be recycled across 
Pump vibrations. When vibrations increases there will be cavitation in pumps which caused impeller damage.
